## A Note/Task Manager using `React`

### In this project:

  - It Consumes `API`:
    - [`Moment.js`](https://momentjs.com/), external;
    - [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), browser's API.
  - I Use React to:
    - A `form` that gets `data from the user`;
    - Manipulating the `JSX` to print it in the screen;
    - Treats the date using `Moment.JS`;
    - Saves the user's note even reloading the page using `localStorage`;

### How to `run` this project:
  - Open the terminal in the project folder and then, enter:
    - `npm init`
    - `npm install moment`
  - After that just enter:
    - `npm start`
 
And enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
